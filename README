h2. What is this?

blah is a tool that creates padrino projects.


h2. Why?

I wanted to use bundler, but IMO, bundler gems should be local to a project. And, there should not be any global gems available when working in a project to prevent accidental usage of said gems.

But, it is a pain to set your gem environment to one with padrino and bundler to get a padrino project started. So, I created this little app.


h2. How Does It Work?

Put this app in your path and it will create a '.gem-padrino' directory in your home directory and install the necessary gems to create a padrino project that is bundled. Then it will create your padrino project. Feel free to modify the 'padrino g' command to use your favorite stack options.
